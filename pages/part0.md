### Prerequisites ###

### Course material ###

The course material is meant to be read sequentially, part by part, from start to finish. To get a passing grade you have to complete each exercise. The exercises are placed in the material in such a way that you will have learned the necessary skills from the material prior to each given exercise. You can do the exercises as you're going through the material.

Please make a [pull request](/contributing) to the course material if you find any mistakes or wish to add something. You can also [contribute](/contributing) through GitHub.

### Completing course ###

The course is composed of N parts, first of which is part 0 and contains the pre-requisites for all the upcoming exercises. The parts should take 5-25 hours each to complete.

Here are additional instructions for completion are after each part and on the [exercises page](/exercises)

### Grading and deadline ##

The course has a pass/fail grading.

The sign up for ECTS credits ends XX.XX.202X! The course ends XX.XX.202X. After that course is locked and submissions can no longer be made or credits earned. As the certificate is received through submissions, you have to submit everything before the course ends. More details under completion and after each part.

## Completion ##

The certificate is available from the small icon beneath your submissions!

After you have returned all of the required exercises and wish to end your course completion and want the ECTS credits press the following button in the submission application (ignore the message about an "exam" as there is no exam in this course):

### Course has multiple pages ###

As we're trying to make the course as accessible as possible, the course has multiple pages: [Studies page](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cur/hy-CUR-135622221/Open_uni_DevOps_with_Docker_2021), [Mooc](https://mooc.fi/) and a GitHub page. Everything should be found from this page. If something is missing or unclear after reading this page, please contact otto.ahoniemi@helsinki.fi or get in touch through Discord.

## How to return exercises ##

Make a repository to GitHub and publish your solutions in clearly ordered files / folders.
If you need help publishing using git you should refer to their [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Make sure that the repository is available to me, either by using a public repository or a private repository and adding otahontas as a collaborator.

When you have completed a part, use the [submission application](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/golang2022) to mark your exercises. You can **not** edit a submission so make sure you have completed enough exercises for a part before submitting.
